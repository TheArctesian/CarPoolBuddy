<strong>Description: </strong> I have been pondering whether I should listen to the lagos and step outside of my comfort zone and back into java as I am not the most comfortable in java and svelte is definitely in my comfort zone. However I am building a lot of other web apps in the future. So I decided to use sveltekit as it is next but svelte so still carries some degree of difficulty for me. And since sveltekit is what I believe the future of webdev and I since it is currently so niche I would love to master it. I will also only be using ts as it is the most like java. Anyways I am sorry lagos. But today I inited firebase and stole code from here [link](https://github.com/CaptainCodeman/sveltekit-example) to init firebase in sveltekit.
